## useMemo --> S useMemo hook is very important hook in react . it is used for caching the function call assume in your applicatin there is 3 components header,hero-section and one more component . so when we click in header there is a counter so the whole component will re-render but in our app herosection do very heavy calculation we dont want to again and again call herosection so we will use useMemo hook it will memorize the function call and will not render it . it is all about useMemo.
