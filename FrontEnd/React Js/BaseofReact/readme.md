// In this file i am going to learn how react is actually working behind the scene we know there are two ways to get react into our project with using cdn links and using npm || yarn.but understand how it works behind the scene .so when we get react into our code whole code of react get into our file and we use that let me show you how it actually works

// Problem 1 -> we have to create a element h2 we will create it with docuemnt.createElement("h2") and it is object at the end of the day we will put innerText style using . dot operator but it is very lengthy and hectic and code becaomes very unreadable so let us learn with react

// Solution below the line this is how react code is written in the react files that we use from cdn and using npm

// Cdn full form is content delviery network where he code of reactand reacrt-dom is hosted and through links we get that into our project

// react and react-dom both are diffrent libraries they are written separately bcause react is used in web development app developmenet so in  app development there is no html or dom thats why react is same everywhere but manipulate library is diffrent
